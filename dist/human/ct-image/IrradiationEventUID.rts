         There is not necessarily a 1:1 relationship between an Irradiation Event and an Acquisition. An Acquisition may not involve the use of ionizing radiation, in which case this Attribute would be absent. A single Acquisition may result from more than one Irradiation Event, e.g., when there are multiple X-Ray sources. More than one Irradiation Event may be involved in a single Acquisition, e.g., when there is a quiescent period between Irradiation Events during which data gathering continues.
