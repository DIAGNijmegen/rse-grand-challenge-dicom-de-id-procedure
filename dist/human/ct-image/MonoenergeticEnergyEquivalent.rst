       <p>
        Single energy equivalent in keV.

       <p>
        Required if Image Type (0008,0008) Value 4 in the CT Image IOD, Image Type (0008,0008) Value 5 in the Enhanced CT Image IOD or Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 5 in the Enhanced CT Image IOD Frame is EQUAL to VMI. May be present otherwise.

        <p>
         If the Image Type (0008,0008) Value 4 in the CT Image IOD, Image Type (0008,0008) Value 5 in the Enhanced CT Image IOD or Frame Type (0008,9007) Value 5 in the Enhanced CT Image IOD Frame is (MAT_REMOVED, MAT_MODIFIED) and a VMI image was used as the source then this Value reflects the keV value of the VMI image.
