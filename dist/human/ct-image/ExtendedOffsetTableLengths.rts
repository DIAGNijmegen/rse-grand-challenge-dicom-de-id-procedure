            This Attribute is only sent when each Frame is entirely contained within one Fragment as a single contiguous span of bytes so that it is not necessary to assemble the Frame from Fragments with delimiters.

           <p>
            The length encoded in this Attribute may be an odd number if the compressed bitstream for the Frame is an odd length; i.e., it does not include any trailing padding required to make the Item an even length.
