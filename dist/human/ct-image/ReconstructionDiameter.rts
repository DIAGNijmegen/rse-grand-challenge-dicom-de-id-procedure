        Diameter in mm of the region from within which data were used in creating the reconstruction of the image. Data may exist outside this region and portions of the patient may exist outside this region.

        The diameter defines a circular region that is entirely contained within the encoded Pixel Data (7FE0,0010), unless the encoded image has been cropped after reconstruction.

         If not cropped or padded, for square images with square pixels, both Values of Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) will be equal and equal to Reconstruction Diameter (0018,1100) / Rows (0028,0010) and Reconstruction Diameter (0018,1100) / Columns (0028,0011).
